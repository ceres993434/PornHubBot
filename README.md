> Disclaimer: This project is intended to study the Scrapy Spider Framework and the MongoDB database, it cannot be used for commercial or other personal intentions. If used improperly, it will be the individuals bear.

* The project is mainly used for crawling a Website, the largest site in the world. In doing so it retrieves video titles, duration, mp4 link, cover url and direct Website`s url.
* This project crawls PornHub.com quickly, but with a simple structure.
* This project can crawl up to 5 millon Website`s videos per day, depending on your personal network. Because of my slow bandwith my results are relatively slow.
* The crawler requests 10 threads at a time, and because of this can achieve the speed mentioned above. If your network is more performant you can request more threads and crawl a larger amount of videos per day. For the specific configuration see [pre-boot configuration]


## Environment, Architecture

Language: Python2.7

Environment: MacOS, 4G RAM
